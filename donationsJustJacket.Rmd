Dear `r params$fname`,  

The GWRFC Alumni Association wants to first take this time to thank you for your 
donation of $`r params$donation` as well as your support throughout the years. The GWRFC 
Alumni Association has provided a jacket worth $200 to you. Consequently, the 
amount of your $`r params$donation` donation that is deductible for federal income 
tax purposes is limited to the excess of any money contributed over the value of 
goods provided by the GWRFC Alumni Association.

Best regards,
